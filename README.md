# Firmware-System

## Main Components
* Raspberry Pi: The central processing unit of the robot. It is used to receive commands from the control station, control the robot as needed, and provide feedback to the station. 
* USB TO CAN: Bridge for the Raspberry Pi to communicate with other ECUs on the CAN bus. 
* Stepper driver: ECU for controlling the stepper motors with control of the motion of the upper plate.
* ODrive: ECU for controlling the brushless DC motors.

## Main Features

### ROS2 
We used it to provide an interface for the robot such that the higher-level control algorithms used in manual and autonomous modes arenâ€™t dependent on the hardware of the robot. And to test all that We built a simulation environment on Gazebo. 

### CAN 
We implemented CAN communication to facilitate data exchange between various Electronic Control Units (ECUs) within the robot. This ensures efficient and reliable communication among the different components.

### USB 
We utilized USB communication for interaction between the Raspberry Pi and the ECUs. This setup enables smooth data transfer and command execution, enhancing the overall system performance.
